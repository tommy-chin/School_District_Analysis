# PyCitySchools Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
A client named Maria requested that an analysis be done on the performance trends and patterns on the city school districts that she oversees. An initial analysis was completed with all of the schools in the school district. However, it was then requested that the math and reading standardized testing scores of the 9th grade class for Thomas High School be excluded from the analysis due to academic dishonesty. In this analysis, the student standardized testing performances and the spending budgets of the schools excluding the 9th grade class of Thomas High School will be compared to the original analysis that was performed.
