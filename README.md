# PyCitySchools Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
A client named Maria requested that an analysis be done on the performance trends and patterns on the city school districts that she oversees. An initial analysis was completed with all of the schools in the school district. However, it was then requested that the math and reading standardized testing scores of the 9th grade class for Thomas High School be excluded from the analysis due to academic dishonesty. In this analysis, the student standardized testing performances and the spending budgets of the schools excluding the 9th grade class of Thomas High School will be compared to the original analysis that was performed. 
## Results
* __How is the district summary affected?__ 
  * Since Thomas High School is a charter school and not a district school, the overall district summary was not changed from the initial analysis and the new analysis.
  * District and Charter School Overall Summary Before Thomas High School 9th Grade Exclusion

* __How is the school summary affected?__
  *  In the school summary, the percentage of students passing the math and reading standardized testing were extremely affected. Before the Thomas High School 9th grade testing scores were excluded, the percentage of students passing math was 93.27% and the percentage after the exclusion was 66.91%. The percentage of students passing reading was 97.31% initially and the percentage after the exclusion was 69.66%. This would lead to the overall percentage of students passing going from 90.95% to 65.08%.
