# PyCitySchools Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
A client named Maria requested that an analysis be done on the performance trends and patterns on the city school districts that she oversees. It was also requested that the standardized testing performances of the 9th grade class for Thomas High School be excluded from the analysis due to academic dishonesty. In this analysis, the student standardized testing performances and the spending budgets of the schools will be the main focus.
